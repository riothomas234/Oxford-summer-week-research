# Oxford-summer-week-research

During this week, we produced a poster to present to researchers about the efficiency of perovskite cells across the world. The models we used were based on Moot et al., ACS Energy Letters (2021) and we obtained J-V plots from a solar simulator in lab. The poster is the file 'oxford research.pdf'

The scientific principle for the poster can be found in the document named 'Modelling Photovoltaic efficiency'.
